		<p>Kia ora, my name is Peter McDonald. I live in North East Valley and for some years have belonged to Transition Valley 473, a group interested in helping our community with
		the transition to a low carbon economy that does not rely on large inputs of fossil fuels. My particular interest is in bicycles and I enjoy volunteering at the Valley Workspace
		because it provides space and a good platform to engage with all sorts of people and promote the conservation and reuse of bicycles and increased bicycling in our community and
		more widely. Enjoy the ride.</p>

		<p>Hello, my name is Guy Pringle. For me, riding and fixing bicycles encourages a sense of independence and freedom. Therefore I want to share this enjoyment with as many people
		as possible. Through <a href="https://malcam.org.nz/">Malcam Trust</a> I am able to support any youth aged 12-24 that needs a bicycle or wants to fix one up. Get in touch with me if you'd like to learn more at:
		guy@malcam.org.nz.</p>

		<p>Hello, my name is Pablo Paulsen. I enjoy cycling a lot so I began volunteering at the valley community bicycle workshop to learn more about repairing bicycles. I continue to
		volunteer because I enjoy repairing bicycles and teaching others to repair their bicycles. During my time here I have learnt a lot about fixing bicycles and gained lots of
		practical experience.</p>

		<p>Kia ora, my name is Alex Gorrie. I enjoy volunteering at the Valley Workspace because it provides a good platform to learn and develop new skills and engage with all sorts of
		people. The projects here tend to be involved with moving away from fossil fuel dependence, and this is something that really interests me.</p>
