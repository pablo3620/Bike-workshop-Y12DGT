		<h2>Our Mission</h2>
		<p>As an integral part of the community led education and development venture (<a href="https://valleyworkspace.org/">Valley Community Workspace</a>) our goal is to promote
		bikes as a form of transport as well as recreation for both young and old. By helping cyclists with advice, tools, spares and hands on repairs from our enthusiastic volunteers,
		we aim to encourage cycling and similar forms of self-propelled locomotion for transport and recreation in our community. We accomplish our goal by firstly taking in unwanted
		bike, parts or accessories for reuse, recycle or resale. Then our volunteers rescue, repair and distribute the bikes, parts or accessories for use in the community minimising
		wasted and disposing of unusable materials responsibly. Our dedication to bicycles and assisting the community enables us to work while enjoying the company of other and having
		fun in a community setting.</p>
